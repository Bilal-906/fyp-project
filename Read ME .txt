How to run the Streamlit app

1) Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it (PowerShell):

	python -m venv .venv
	.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

2) Upgrade pip and install dependencies:

	python -m pip install --upgrade pip
	pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Run the app with Streamlit:

	streamlit run app.py

Notes and troubleshooting
- If you get TensorFlow/GPU errors, you probably installed a CPU-only wheel—install a GPU-enabled TensorFlow matching your CUDA/cuDNN stack, or use the CPU wheel if you don't have a GPU.
- If ports are in use, add `--server.port 8501` (or another port) to the `streamlit run` command, e.g.:

	streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502

- If Streamlit can't find `app.py`, ensure you're running the command from the project root where `app.py` lives.
- To deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud, create a `requirements.txt` (already added) and push this repo to GitHub; Streamlit Cloud will install dependencies automatically.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add these instructions into a new `README.md` instead (more standard for GitHub).
- Add a small `Procfile` or `Dockerfile` for specific hosting targets.
