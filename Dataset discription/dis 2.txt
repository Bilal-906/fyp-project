### 📘 **Network Attack Detection Dataset — Detailed Description**

The **Network Attack Detection Dataset** is a synthetic dataset created to simulate real-world network traffic for the purpose of detecting malicious activities and differentiating them from normal network behavior. It consists of **1,000 samples** (rows) and **205 features** (columns), designed to represent various network flow statistics, metadata, and indicators that are commonly used in intrusion detection systems. The dataset is balanced, with roughly equal proportions of normal and attack samples, and is structured to yield approximately **85–90% accuracy** when used with standard machine learning classifiers such as Random Forests, Logistic Regression, or XGBoost.

The dataset’s **first 200 columns (f1–f200)** are numeric features that represent different aspects of network connection statistics and traffic behavior. These features are derived to mimic real metrics found in packet-level analysis and network monitoring tools. Features `f1` to `f20` represent flow volume metrics, including total packet and byte counts in both directions of communication. Features `f21` to `f40` capture time and duration metrics such as average packet inter-arrival times and connection durations. Columns `f41` to `f60` represent rate-based features, like data transfer speed and packet rates. The next group, `f61` to `f80`, corresponds to header-level statistics such as the number of TCP flags and average header size. Features `f81` to `f100` capture variability and statistical measures like variance, skewness, and entropy in packet or byte distributions. Columns `f101` to `f120` represent content-based indicators, which might describe payload entropy or suspicious keyword presence. The next range, `f121` to `f140`, models connection behavior features, including counts of failed login attempts or reset connections. Features `f141` to `f160` capture host-based aggregate measures such as the average packets or bytes per host session, while `f161` to `f180` summarize overall flow statistics through mean and standard deviation measures. Finally, the remaining `f181` to `f200` are low-variance or random noise features included to simulate real-world data imperfections and increase robustness during model training. All numeric columns have been standardized to zero mean and unit variance.

In addition to these numerical attributes, the dataset includes **three categorical features** that simulate real network metadata typically found in intrusion detection datasets. The first categorical column, **`protocol_type`**, identifies the type of network protocol used in each connection and can take one of three values: `tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp`. This helps models distinguish behaviors typical to different communication types. The second categorical column, **`service`**, specifies the network service or port associated with the flow, including possible values such as `http`, `ftp`, `smtp`, `dns`, `ssh`, `telnet`, and `pop3`. This reflects which application or service was being accessed or targeted, as certain attacks are service-specific (for example, brute-force attacks over SSH or flooding attacks on HTTP). The third categorical feature, **`flag`**, represents the connection status based on TCP flags and indicates how a connection was completed or terminated. Its possible values — `SF`, `S0`, `REJ`, `RSTR`, and `SH` — simulate the final state of network handshakes and help identify anomalies such as incomplete or reset sessions.

The **`label`** column serves as the **target variable**, indicating whether a given network flow is malicious (`attack`) or benign (`normal`). This label is used for supervised machine learning tasks in which the model learns to distinguish between attack patterns and legitimate traffic. To support model evaluation and reproducibility, the dataset also includes a **`split`** column that assigns each record to either the training or testing subset. The split follows an 80/20 ratio, with 80% of the samples allocated for training and 20% reserved for testing, ensuring consistent and fair evaluation of machine learning models.

This dataset is particularly well-suited for research and experimentation in **network intrusion detection**, **binary classification**, **anomaly detection**, and **feature selection**. It provides a realistic mix of informative, redundant, and noisy features, reflecting the complexity of real-world network environments. By combining numerical traffic indicators with categorical protocol-level metadata, the dataset encourages models to learn both behavioral and structural patterns of malicious traffic. It can be used to benchmark classifiers, evaluate feature importance, or test feature selection algorithms. The inclusion of random noise and redundant variables ensures that the dataset challenges models to generalize rather than memorize patterns.

In summary, the **Network Attack Detection Dataset** offers a carefully balanced and feature-rich simulation of network flow data for supervised learning. It captures essential aspects of network communication — including volume, timing, rate, protocol, and session behavior — while maintaining enough complexity to support realistic intrusion detection research. With standardized numeric values, categorical metadata, and clearly defined labels, it provides a reliable and interpretable foundation for developing and testing machine learning models that detect cyberattacks and anomalous network activity.
